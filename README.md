# (Me)dium

(Me)dium is a clone of the poular online publishing platform Medium.

## About The Project

(Me)dium was developed as an excercize to advance and display my full stack development abilities. The entire project from the back-end to
the front-end was developed with the goal of emulating the functionality and appearance of the real Medium. Since this is a portfolio project,
I've decided to emphasize the 'Me' in Medium and display humorous articles about myself and why employers may want to hire me.
